##Queer-Quote
Created for outLoud Radio. An interactive widget that syncs the audio from a podcast with the text from a transcript. At any point during playback, the current text or quote can be converted into an image, with customizable colors, and then shared to facebook.

Not only does this make the audio more *accessible*, but our hope is that it will drive user engagement and make ouLoud Radio more *visible* on social media.

[Demo it here](http://samsamskies.github.io/Queer-Quote/)
